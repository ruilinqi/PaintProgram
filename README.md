# myprojectï¼šPaint Program
Project Name: Paint Program

Description: 
This is a simple raster drawing program. In general, there are two panels, the control panel and the canvas panel. It shows many basic functions on the control panel, mainly providing the user with the ability to select any button and draw it on the canvas panel.
When the program opens, select the first button, the draw or fill option, to draw a hollow or solid shape. The second button provides the ability to change the color. Then choose three different 2D shapes (rectangle, oval and line). You can now draw graphics on the canvas panel by clicking, dragging, and releasing the mouse. In addition, the pencil button can also be clicked to do any drawing. Next, you can click on the eraser function, which is used to clean up on a small scale. Finally, the drawing software also has three functions: going back to the previous step, resetting, and exiting the program.
